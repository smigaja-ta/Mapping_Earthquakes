GeoJSON Group Activity!

Description:  As a group you are going to choose a GeoJSON data set of your own to load and style however you want!

Provided is the basic website and template code.

Remember to work as a group.  Working with your peers is an essential part of development where collaboration is key.
Choose someone tech-savvy to share their screen, task students with looking up things like how to style something or to further analyze the GeoJSON data, and most of all have fun with this.  

Groups that get their data set loaded will have an opportunity to share with the class.

Instructions
1.  Each group is to choose a data set to work with.
    Kaggle hosts many geoJSON datasets which are easy to download and work with.

2.  The group will look over the data set and discuss what
    they could do with it. Be creative!

3.  The group will load the basic data set geometries.

4.  The group will style the data set based on the feature's 
    properties.

Straightforward but with many possibilities. There will be one TA per room to answer questions and help if you get stuck with some of the syntax.
